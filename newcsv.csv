25;<p> The National Statistical Office (NSO) webpage provides detailed information on the organigram of the NSO if it reports on its organisational structure and the roles of its staff. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the country to score 1 on the indicator. Conversely, it is not sufficient to report the names of the members of the NSO without including their role neither aggregate the number of employees in the staff. </p> ;<p> Data come from online desk research, where information is fetched from the NSO webpage.  The research involves a process of refinement of searching techniques in order to guarantee the relevance and completeness of the results and a training process for the researcher to know the guidelines and comply with the definition of the indicator. If the NSO webpage is not publicly accessible or the URL fails to open the website, the country is considered not to provide detailed information on the NSO organigram and therefore it is assigned a score of zero. </p> ;<p> The reported score for each country is a binary variable which takes value 1 if the NSO webpage is found to be reporting detailed information on the NSO organisational structure and 0 otherwise. Most of the times, the country does not provide information on the last update of the organisational structure, therefore it is difficult for the researcher to infer whether the information on the names of the members, their role and the aggregate number of employees for each position are up to date. For this reason, details on the NSO organization only involve the organisational structure, whose changes are presumably less frequent and could furtherly be ascertained from press releases. </p> ;<p> The aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level represents the unweighted sample average of the indicator scores of each country for the reference geographic area, where regional classification of economies is based on the M49 UN classification. The unweighted sample average of a binary indicator represents the share of countries in the aggregate of interest which scored 1 in the indicator. Countries with missing values are not included in the computation, thus users should be cautious when interpreting aggregate figures as representative of the area of interest and comparing them across aggregates. The aggregation to income level groups (High Income, Upper Middle Income, Lower Middle Income and Low Income) and geopolitical classification – i.e. Fragile State, Least Developed Country, Landlocked Developing State, Small Islands Developing States – follow World Bank and UN classification of economies. These aggregations are updated annually, therefore users should be cautious when comparing groups across time, due to composition changes. </p> ;<p> Due to missing data, aggregates for groups of economies should be treated as approximations of unknown totals or average values. Regional and income group aggregates are based on the largest available set of data. Small differences between sums of subgroup aggregates and overall totals might be due to approximations. Moreover, compilation errors and data reporting practices may lead to discrepancies in theoretically identical aggregates. This indicator has undertaken a significant process of revision in terms of collection methods and definition as of the 2019 update, therefore users should be cautious when comparing figures before and after 2019 update. </p> ;
50;<p> This indicator measures the language accessibility of the NSO webpage. A country scores 1 in the indicator of language accessibility if the National Statistical Office (NSO) webpage provides information in another language in addition to the national official language. The second language of the webpage interface can be either English, French or Spanish in order for the NSO webpage to be defined language-accessible. Those countries whose official language is already English, French or Spanish and which provide information only in the official national language are considered language accessible and are given score 1. </p> ;<p> Data come from online desk research, where information is fetched from the NSO webpage.

It might be the case that the country provides the option to enable an interface in another language than the official one but does not concretely give access to the same amount of information as the official language version. In that case the country is given a score of zero. The choice of the second language which determines the language accessibility of the country – English, Spanish or French – is not arbitrary, but is based on empirical evidence and literature review. The results of the research indicated that there are no NSO webpages which provide information in an additional language that is not either an official national language or English, Spanish or French. </p> ;<p> The aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level represents the unweighted sample average of the indicator scores of each country for the reference geographic area, where regional classification of economies is based on the M49 UN classification.

63;<p> A country provides access to a national database or national data portal if – following the definition by the UNSD – the NSO webpage provides access to a generic, stand-alone web-based, interactive data and metadata platform with database modelled for specific data types and domains such as microdata, aggregate data or geospatial data.

67;<p> A country has a National Statistical Council if there exists an agency, board or institution whose main function is to advise the Chief Statistician on the activities of the national statistical office, primarily on programme priorities. The National Statistical Council aims at ensuring an objective and transparent functioning of the national statistical activity and its methodology, indicators, metadata and classifications. It also fosters the debate and formulates recommendations on the improvement of tools and mechanisms regarding the National Statistical System functioning. The National Statistical Council might change name across countries: it might be defined as National Statistical Board, National Statistical Commission or National Statistical Committee.

105;"<p> The share of foreign support devoted to demographic and social statistics is a rolling-average of the support received over the previous ten years. It is one of the five categories in which aid to statistics is broken down across areas of international statistical activities (demographic and social statistics; economic statistics; environmental and multi-sectoral statistics; general data collection, preservation and dissemination; strategic and managerial issues of official statistics) based on the Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA) adopted by the UN (<a href=""https://unstats.un.org/unsd/iiss/Classification-of-International-Statistical-Activities.ashx""> See here. </a>). Subcategories of demographic and social statistics include: population and migration; labor; education; health; income and consumption; social protection; human settlements and housing; justice and crime; culture; political and other community activities; time use. The breakdown of aid to statistics across areas of statistical development in five categories allows for a cross-country comparison for a given ten-year time period or a cross-indicator comparison within a country. Commitment is defined by the OECD glossary as “a firm obligation […] undertaken by an official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organization”. The share of foreign support to demographic and social statistics provides a measurement of the importance of such statistics for donor countries. </p> ";"<p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to donors not covered by the CRS. </p> 

<p> The Creditor Reporting System (CRS) is the official source of information on aid commitments from OECD member countries, as well as several multilateral organizations. Established in 1967, the CRS aid activity database has become the internationally recognized source of data on the geographical and sectoral breakdown of aid, widely used by governments, organizations and researchers active in the field of development. The indicator draws on the official development assistance portion of the database, which includes both geographic and sectoral information on projects, to identify aid that is targeted at statistics. The CRS also includes data on other official flows and export credits. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity – statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by the sector code 16062. However, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, which causes the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. </p> 

<p> The PARIS21 Secretariat supplements these data with an online questionnaire, which is completed by a global network of respondents. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS, as well as some additional variables specific to SCB. Responding to the questionnaire is voluntary and offers an opportunity for actors to share information about their statistical activities. Respondents are from countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as from multilateral institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects who have requested to report directly to PARIS21. </p> 

<p> The indicator methodology relies on a <u> text-mining technique </u>, which allows identifying statistics projects in the CRS database not labelled as “support to statistics”. This method avoids counting of projects from Development Assistance Committee members twice, who use only CRS as data source.   </p> 

<p> To identify commitments to statistics within project descriptions in the CRS database, the technique uses a set of 200 keyword sequences in three different languages (English, Spanish, French). The identification follows a three-stage process. First, project descriptions are split by language; commonly used words such as ‘the’, ‘is’, and ‘at’ are ignored; and the remaining words are reduced to their word lemmatization. Second, for each language, word sequences (such as ‘statist capac’ for statistical capacity) are identified as being related to statistics if they are <u> at least four times more likely to appear </u> in projects labelled as ‘support to statistics’ (designated by purpose code 16062) than in those not labelled as such. Third, word sequences are verified manually by analyzing the corresponding sentences. </p> 

<p> Limiting the analysis to 20 sector codes allows further context-specific control. For instance, projects in the mineral prospection and exploration sector use geospatial data from field surveys, but do not contribute to a country’s statistical capacity. The analysis therefore only considers sector codes that are frequently reported together with sector code 16062 for statistics. </p> <p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to donors not covered by the CRS. </p>

107;"<p> The share of foreign support devoted to environmental and multi-sectoral statistics is a rolling-average of the support received over the previous ten years. It is one of the five categories in which aid to statistics is broken down across areas of international statistical activities (demographic and social statistics; economic statistics; environmental and multi-sectoral statistics; general data collection, preservation and dissemination; strategic and managerial issues of official statistics) based on the Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA) adopted by the UN (<a href=""https://unstats.un.org/unsd/iiss/Classification-of-International-Statistical-Activities.ashx""> See here. </a>). Subcategories of environmental and multi-sectoral statistics include: environment; regional and small area statistics; multi‐domain statistics and indicators; living conditions, poverty; gender and special population groups; information society; globalization; indicators related to the Millennium Development Goals; sustainable development; yearbooks and similar compendia. The breakdown of aid to statistics across areas of statistical development in five categories allows for a cross-country comparison for a given ten-year time period or a cross-indicator comparison within a country. Commitment is defined by the OECD glossary as “a firm obligation […] undertaken by an official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organization”.  The share of foreign support to demographic and social statistics provides a measurement of the importance of such statistics for donor countries. </p> ";"<p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to donors not covered by the CRS. </p> 

<p> The Creditor Reporting System (CRS) is the official source of information on aid commitments from OECD member countries, as well as several multilateral organizations. Established in 1967, the CRS aid activity database has become the internationally recognized source of data on the geographical and sectoral breakdown of aid, widely used by governments, organizations and researchers active in the field of development. The indicator draws on the official development assistance portion of the database, which includes both geographic and sectoral information on projects, to identify aid targeting statistics. The CRS also includes data on other official flows and export credits. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity – statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by the sector code 16062. However, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, which causes the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. </p> 

<p> The PARIS21 Secretariat supplements these data with an online questionnaire, which is completed by a global network of respondents. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS, as well as some additional variables specific to SCB. Responding to the questionnaire is voluntary and offers an opportunity for actors to share information about their statistical activities. Respondents are from countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as from multilateral institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects who have requested to report directly to PARIS21. </p> 

<p> The indicator methodology relies on a <u> text-mining technique </u> , which allows identifying statistics projects in the CRS database not labelled as “support to statistics”. This method avoids counting of projects from Development Assistance Committee members twice, who use only CRS as data source.   </p> 

<p> To identify commitments to statistics within project descriptions in the CRS database, the technique uses a set of 200 keyword sequences in three different languages (English, Spanish, French). The identification follows a three-stage process. First, project descriptions are split by language; commonly used words such as ‘the’, ‘is’, and ‘at’ are ignored; and the remaining words are reduced to their word lemmatization. Second, for each language, word sequences (such as ‘statist capac’ for statistical capacity) are identified as being related to statistics if they are <u> at least four times more likely to appear </u> in projects labelled as ‘support to statistics’ (designated by purpose code 16062) than in those not labelled as such. Third, word sequences are verified manually by analyzing the corresponding sentences. </p> 

<p> Limiting the analysis to 20 sector codes allows further context-specific control. For instance, projects in the mineral prospection and exploration sector use geospatial data from field surveys, but do not contribute to a country’s statistical capacity.

This indicator <b> refers to the first level </b> of statistical literacy defined as an appropriate but non-critical engagement with context and multiple aspects of terminology usage (levels based on a framework developed by from Watson and Callingham (2003)). A high score of the indicator illustrates a higher probability of statistical concepts being used in media articles and thus offers an indirect measure of the use of and non-critical engagement with statistics. </p> ";"<p> Data come from national newspaper articles from RSS feeds.

As a result, there is a different denominator per level of statistical literacy, since the number of analysed newspaper articles varies. </p>

Statistical literacy is defined as “the ability to critically evaluate statistical material and to appreciate the relevance of statistically-based approaches to all aspects of life in general” (Dodge and Marriott, 2003; see <a href=https://paris21.org/statistical-literacy-2019>literature review</a>). This indicator <b> refers to the second level </b> of statistical literacy defined as questioning engagement in contexts that do not involve proportional reasoning, but which do involve appropriate use of terminology. (levels based on a framework developed by from Watson and Callingham (2003)). A high score of the indicator illustrates a higher probability of statistical concepts being used in media articles and thus offers an indirect measure of the use of and critical engagement with statistics. </p> ";"<p> Data come from national newspaper articles from RSS feeds. By definition, illiterate population and those without access to print or online media are excluded. </p> 

<p> The methodology classifies articles in four languages (English, French, Spanish and Portuguese) into literacy levels 1 to 3 based on three corresponding keyword lists. Each keyword list contains different terms referring to statistics and statistical fallacies, and the use of one precise category of keywords by one newspaper article allows for defining one level of statistical literacy. As a result, there is a different denominator per level of statistical literacy, since the number of analysed newspaper articles varies. </p> 

<p> The keyword lists have been constructed based on major statistical data sources, such as standards internationally adopted by NSOs, International Organisations, books, articles and glossaries specialized in statistics and statistical fallacies (e.g. the OECD Glossary of Statistical Fallacies; Glossary of Statistical Terms by the University of California, Berkeley, for English keywords; or the Glossário Inglês-Português de Estatística for Portuguese keywords).

121;<p> The level of total commitments provides a tool to compare the needs of recipient countries and the progress to implement the Cape Town Global Action Plan across countries. The level of total commitments does not breakdown aid to statistics across areas of statistical development. Commitment is defined by the OECD glossary as “a firm obligation […] undertaken by an official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organization”. The indicator allows for a cross-country comparison in a given year or a time-series analysis for a given country. </p> ;"<p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to donors not covered by the CRS. </p> 
<p> The Creditor Reporting System (CRS) is the official source of information on aid commitments from OECD member countries, as well as several multilateral organisations. Established in 1967, the CRS aid activity database has become the internationally recognised source of data on the geographical and sectoral breakdown of aid, widely used by governments, organisations and researchers active in the field of development. The indicator draws on the official development assistance portion of the database, which includes both geographic and sectoral information on projects, to identify aid that is targeted at supporting statistics. The CRS also includes data on other official flows and export credits. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity – statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by the sector code 16062. However, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, which causes the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. </p> 
<p> The PARIS21 Secretariat supplements these data with an online questionnaire, which is completed by a global network of respondents. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS, as well as some additional variables specific to SCB. Responding to the questionnaire is voluntary and offers an opportunity for actors to share information about their statistical activities. Respondents are from countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as from multilateral institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects who have requested to report directly to PARIS21. </p> 
<p> The indicator methodology relies on a <u> text-mining technique </u>, which allows identifying statistics projects in the CRS database not labelled as “support to statistics”. This method avoids counting of projects from Development Assistance Committee members twice, who use only CRS as data source.   </p> 
<p> To identify commitments to statistics within project descriptions in the CRS database, the technique uses a set of 200 keyword sequences in three different languages (English, Spanish, French). The identification follows a three-stage process. First, project descriptions are split by language; commonly used words such as ‘the’, ‘is’, and ‘at’ are ignored; and the remaining words are reduced to their word lemmatization. Second, for each language, word sequences (such as ‘statist capac’ for statistical capacity) are identified as being related to statistics if they are <u> at least four times more likely to appear <u/> in projects labelled as ‘support to statistics’ (designated by purpose code 16062) than in those not labelled as such. Third, word sequences are verified manually by analysing the corresponding sentences. </p> 
<p> Limiting the analysis to 20 sector codes allows further context-specific control. For instance, projects in the mineral prospection and exploration sector use geospatial data from field surveys, but do not contribute to a country’s statistical capacity. The analysis therefore only considers sector codes that are frequently reported together with sector code 16062 for statistics. </p> <p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to donors not covered by the CRS. </p>

127;<p> Use of Sstatistics (UoS) is defined as the systematic use of statistical knowledge to inform programme design and policy choice, monitor policy implementation and evaluate policy impact. The indicator measures the probability of a document exhibiting a certain characteristic or fitting into a category (in this case, “evidence-informed policy”). It hence provides a benchmark for the extent to which a country references statistical concepts in its national policy planning documents (National Development Plans/ Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers). NDPs and PRSPs are public documents that lay down government commitments for the medium term and are the foundation on which to hold them accountable. A “statistical concept” is considered to be any measurable value given in the report (i.e. absolute values, percentages, or fractions) at the country level. It does not include exogenously determined variables (e.g. world interest rates), given geographical features (land area, coastline, etc.), or government financing figures. A high value of the use of statistics indicator provides evidence that a country is advanced in their use of statistics and data in their policy documents. </p> ;"<p> Data come from National Development Plans (NDPs) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). The data is extracted through a text-mining methodology. The indicator uses the Wordscores method, which scores documents based on the presence of a list of keywords defined from reference texts and indicator databases, to evaluate the use of statistics in policy documents (NDPs and PSRPs). </p>  

<p> Three corpuses were selected to define the total list of 958 keywords in English distributed across 16 sectors: policy documents; international databases and frameworks containing monitoring indicators; and statistical dictionaries and course books. The preliminary list of keywords provided from policy documents was complemented by a list of concepts used by international agencies (World Bank, WHO, UNESCO, UNIDO, ITU, UN Women, OCHR, UNWTO, ILO, OECD, EU, UNSD) and a list of statistical terms related to the SDG agenda. A third list of statistical terms was identified from textbooks and dictionaries on statistics, such as the OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms. The keywords list was then translated to French/Spanish and validated by a specialist. </p> 

<p> Word lemmatization (Plisson et al. 2004) was applied to all text and keyword lists and documents before proceeding with the analysis. Lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)>lemma</a>  of a word based on its intended meaning. Unlike  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming>stemming</a>, lemmatisation depends on correctly identifying the intended  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech>part of speech</a>  and meaning of a word in a sentence, as well as within the larger context surrounding that sentence, such as neighbouring sentences or even an entire document. Stop wordsi were removed and characters were converted to lower case. Texts were evaluated at a sentence level, meaning that the scoring is based on the frequency of sentences that use keywords instead of the frequency of keywords. Frequency counts of keywords were weighted proportional to the number of sentences in a document. Part-of-speech tagging was used to identify and distinguish past, present and future tense. </p> 

<p> Countries where those documents were not available count as missing data. </p> ";"<p> The use of statistics indicator is a composite indicator consisting of 4 sub-indices that aim to reflect the relevance of statistical evidence. It comprises four main dimensions: </p> 

<ul> 

<li> Basic consideration (Level 1) is the introduction of a measurable concept for indicating the state of and progress towards a specific development outcome (e.g. food production). </li> 

<li>  Diagnosis and quantification (Level 2) is defined as the depiction of the state of such measurable concept and the presumed causes for its variation (e.g. mortality rate of 5 per 1000 adults, improvement of 5% in adult literacy). </li> 

<li> Statistical analysis (Level 3) is considered to be the highest level of referencing to a statistical concept. A sentence is at Level 3 if it includes use of statistical methods to depict the state of the measurable concept and the causes of its variation (e.g. the improvement of 5% in adult literacy rate is correlated to improvements in life expectancy or the income of the lower quartile). Both mathematical and non-mathematical expressions are included as long as they reflect the relationship between indicators. Providing references/sources is also awarded for Level 3. </li> 

<li> Disaggregation: A broader set of disaggregation keywords was implemented. The structure and keywords of disaggregation originates from the stands for data disaggregation of UNSD. </li> 

</ul> 

<p> The methodology is based on a basic list of “measurable concepts” that is consistent throughout the three levels. For level 3, an additional list of “analytical terms” is added. When a keyword from the “measurable concepts” list is found together with one of the “statistical terms”, the sentence is classified into level 3. If a “measurable concept” is found together with a figure (number), it is assigned to level 2. Finally, if a “measurable concept” is found on its own, it is assigned to level 1. The three levels are mutually exclusive. To avoid double counting, texts are first evaluated at level 3. Then sentences that are not identified as level 3 are evaluated at level 2, and finally at level 1. An overall score for basic use of statistics is then obtained as the weighted sum of the three levels. </p> ";"<p> The sub-indices are aggregated by geometric aggregation due to non-compensability. </p> 

<p> Principal Component Analysis has been used to detect the weights of the composite indicator in line with the recommendations by the OECD Statistical Handbook (2008): </p>

<li> Level 1: 25% </li> 

<li> Level 2: 24% </li> 

<li> Level 3: 22% </li> 

<li> Disaggregation: 29% </li>

135;<p> This indicator measures whether a country’s national statistical legislation complies with the United National Fundamental Principles of Statistics. A country has a statistical legislation that respects the principles of and is compliant with the UN FPOS if the statistics law has provisions relating to all ten Principles. The statistics law defines rules, regulation, measures concerning the organization, management, monitoring and inspection of the statistical activities in a systematic and efficient way in order to ensure the accuracy and consistency to effectively support country’s policy direction and socio-economic planning. </p>  <p> The Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics were adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its Special Session of 11-15 April 1994. The ten principles  can be found <a href=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/hb/E-fundamental%20principles_A4-WEB.pdf >here.</a> </p> <p> This indicator is the official indicator to measure the SDG 17.18.2, which is a Tier I indicator and is part of the wider target 17.18 that aims at enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries to increase the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts. </p> ;"<p> Data come from the PARIS21 SDG annual survey sent to the National Statistics Offices (NSO) of countries through an online form every last quarter of the year. PARIS21 pre-filled the survey for countries that comply with the European Statistics Code of Practice as part of its methods and guidance strategy for international recommendations and guidelines available to countries. The European Statistics Code of Practice is consistent with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, therefore complying with the European Statistics Code of Practice is equivalent to complying with all ten UN Fundamental Principles. </p>

143;<p> A country has an SDG Portal if it provides an official country-operated, dedicated online portal for reporting SDG progress, detailed either in the NSO website or official national government webpage. SDGs require an increasing frequency in reporting and a greater level of disaggregation of data. Reporting SDG information is a signal for the importance of data collection and data portals attributed by the countries.  </p> ;<p> Data come from online desk research, where information is fetched from the NSO webpage as primarily source and from the official national government webpage as a secondary source. The research involves a process of refinement of searching techniques in order to guarantee the relevance and completeness of the results and a training process for the researcher to know the guidelines and comply with the definition of the indicator. If the NSO webpage is not publicly accessible or the URL fails to open the website and further desk research does not provide evidence of the presence of a country-operated SDG Portal, then the country is considered not to have one and it is hence assigned a score of zero. </p> ;<p> The reported score for each country is a binary variable which takes value 1 if the country has an SDG Portal and 0 otherwise, where it is not necessary to report on the totality of the SDG indicators to be assigned score 1. Notably, this indicator does not aim at assessing the frequency with which the SDG Portal information is updated and the level and quality of data disaggregation that are disseminated in the portal. </p> ;<p> The aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level represents the unweighted sample average of the indicator scores of each country for the reference geographic area, where regional classification of economies is based on M49 UN classification.

165;"<p> The status of the National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS) is inferred by PARIS21 in collaboration with its partners by reports on country progresses in design and implementing NSDSs. These reports provide an up-to-date overview of where countries currently are in their NSDS processes. The status of the NSDS can be: i) expired or absent and not planning; ii) expired or absent but planning; iii) designing or adopting; iv) implementing. The first and second categories represent those situations where the existing strategy has expired, and they are distinguished in whether the process to design an NSDS has been initiated (e.g. roadmap) and funding is being sought. The third category means that an NSDS has been designed with funding secured. The fourth category means that an NSDS document has been adopted by the government and is being implemented. The indicator thus provides a proxy measure for the progress of an NSDS process. </p> ";"<p> Data come from three different sources: i) direct information provided by countries to PARIS21; ii) websites of key development partners (e.g. the World Bank’s Bulletin Board on Statistical Capacity); iii) Website of countries’ national statistical offices. The sample of countries includes International Development Association (IDA) eligible countries, Least Developed Countries, Low and Lower-Middle Income Countries, and some Upper-Middle Income Countries (in order to cover all the African continent). </p> ";"<p> The reported score for each country is taken from an ordinal categorical variable whose integer values range from 0 to 3. Score is 0 if the country's NSDS is expired or absent and is not planned; score is 1 if the country has an expired or absent NSDS but is planning it; score is 2 if the country is in the process of designing or adopting an NSDS; score is 3 if the country is implementing an NSDS. </p> ";<p> The aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level represents the unweighted sample frequency of each of the indicator scores for the reference geographic area, where regional classification of economies is based on the M49 UN classification.

167;"<p> The share of foreign support devoted to strategic and managerial issues of official statistics at national and international level is a rolling-average of the support to statistics received over the previous ten years. It is one of the five categories in which aid to statistics is broken down across areas of international statistical activities (demographic and social statistics; economic statistics; environmental and multi-sectoral statistics; general data collection, preservation and dissemination; strategic and managerial issues of official statistics) based on the Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA) adopted by the UN (<a href=""https://unstats.un.org/unsd/iiss/Classification-of-International-Statistical-Activities.ashx""> See here. </a>). Subcategories of “strategic and managerial issues of official statistics at national and international level” include: Institutional frameworks and principles; role of official statistics; statistical law and other legal instruments; Statistical programmes, priority setting, relationships with users and respondents (Statistical programmes in the framework of NSDS, all other statistical programmes, priority settings, relationships with users and respondents); quality frameworks and evaluation exercises; human resources and training; technological resources (including standards for electronic data exchange and data sharing); co‐ordination of international statistical work. The breakdown of aid to statistics across areas of statistical development in five categories allows for a cross-country comparison for a given ten-year time period or a cross-indicator comparison within a country. Commitment is defined by the OECD glossary as “a firm obligation […] undertaken by an official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organization”. The share of foreign support to strategic and managerial issues provides a measurement of the importance of such issues in statistics for donor countries. </p> ";"<p> Data come from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and an internal PARIS21 survey sent to the staff of OECD bilateral development agencies and national statistical offices. </p> 

<p> The Creditor Reporting System (CRS) is the official source of information on aid commitments from OECD member countries, as well as several multilateral organizations. Established in 1967, the CRS aid activity database has become the internationally recognized source of data on the geographical and sectoral breakdown of aid, widely used by governments, organizations and researchers active in the field of development. The indicator draws on the official development assistance portion of the database, which includes both geographic and sectoral information on projects, to identify aid that is targeted at statistics. The CRS also includes data on other official flows and export credits. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity – statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by the sector code 16062. However, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, which causes the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. </p> 

<p> The PARIS21 Secretariat supplements these data with an online questionnaire, which is completed by a global network of respondents, mostly multi-lateral donors. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS, as well as some additional variables specific to SCB. Responding to the questionnaire is voluntary and offers an opportunity for actors to share information about their statistical activities. Respondents are from countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as from multilateral institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects who have requested to report directly to PARIS21. </p> 
<p> The indicator methodology relies on a <u> text-mining technique </u>, which allows identifying statistics projects in the CRS database not labelled as “support to statistics”. This method avoids counting of projects from Development Assistance Committee members twice, who use only CRS as data source.   </p> 

<p> To identify commitments to statistics within project descriptions in the CRS database, the technique uses a set of 150 keyword sequences in three different languages (English, Spanish, French). The identification follows a three-stage process. First, project descriptions are split by language; commonly used words such as ‘the’, ‘is’, and ‘at’ are ignored; and the remaining words are reduced to their word stem. Second, for each language, word sequences (such as ‘statist capac’ for statistical capacity) are identified as being related to statistics if they are <u> at least four times more likely to appear </u> in projects labelled as ‘support to statistics’ (designated by purpose code 16062) than in those not labelled as such. Third, word sequences are verified manually by analyzing the corresponding sentences. </p> 

<p> Limiting the analysis to 20 sector codes allows further context-specific control. For instance, projects in the mineral prospection and exploration sector use geospatial data from field surveys, but do not contribute to a country’s statistical capacity. The analysis therefore only considers sector codes that are frequently reported together with sector code 16062 for statistics. </p> ";"<p> The reported value is the share of foreign support dedicated to strategic and managerial issues of official statistics at national and international level received in the previous ten years. The values of the five indicators representing the shares of foreign support received sum up to 100%. Ratios are computed as the unweighted ratio of each share of aid to statistics devoted to a specific area of statistical development. </p> 

<p> Financial commitments are converted to US dollars using the period-average exchange rate of the commitment year of the projects/programme. If disbursement amounts were reported, the exchange rate adopted was the period-average of the disbursement year.   Amounts recorded refer to total commitments at the country-level. </p> 

<p> The indicator reports only years in which data from both the CRS and the PRESS questionnaire are available to facilitate comparison over time. The CRS report support to statistics with a two-year time lag (e.g. 2017 commitments in January 2019). Consequently, the indicator reports support to statistics with a two-year time-lag. This means that a 2019 issue reports on ten-year commitments up to the period 2007-2017. </p> ";<p> The aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level represents the sample unweighted average of the share of foreign support devoted to general data collection, preservation and dissemination for the reference geographic area, where regional classification of economies is based on the M49 UN classification. Countries with missing values are not included in the computation, thus users should be cautious when interpreting aggregate figures as representative of the area of interest and comparing them across aggregates.
